# Type in the following to learn more about the checksums command:
md5sum --help

# First navigate to the source directory where you want to copy original files from
# Create a file of calculated checksums for the original files in the original source location
# Oftentimes this file will already be generated and available in your sequencing directory
# Save the file to your copied directory if it wasn't pre-generated by the Bauer Sequencing Core, for example
# Provide the filepath to the files you want to check, and the filepath to where you want to save the file 
md5sum fastq/PREP0053/* > ~/md5sum.txt

# Navigate to the copied directory in your lab server which also contains the md5sum.txt file
# Using the -c flag with the md5sum command will allow to you to check the checksums status of all your copied files
# against a file of calculated checksums from the original files (pre-generated by the Bauer Core, or generated by you)
